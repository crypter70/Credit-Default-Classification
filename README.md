# Credit-Default-Classification
 
## Problem 
Credit default poses significant challenges to financial institutions and can lead to substantial financial losses. It is crucial for these institutions to accurately identify potential defaulters to mitigate risks and make informed decisions. However, without effective modeling techniques and insightful analysis of credit data, it becomes difficult to proactively manage credit risk. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop robust classification models and uncover in-depth insights from the data to enhance credit risk management practices and prevent financial instability.

## Objective
This project aims to uncover deep credit insights from data and build the best default credit classification model. It focuses on transforming valuable information and developing high performance models for credit classification.
